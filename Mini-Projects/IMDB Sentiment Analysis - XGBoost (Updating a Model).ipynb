In particular, we will look at the XGBoost sentiment analysis model that we constructed earlier. In this case, however, we have some new data that our model doesn't seem to perform very well on. As a result, we will re-train our model and update an existing endpoint so that it uses our new model.\n",

    "The XGBoost classifier that we will be using requires the dataset to be written to a file and stored using Amazon S3. To do this, we will start by splitting the training dataset into two parts, the data we will train the model with and a validation set. Then, we will write those datasets to a file and upload the files to S3. In addition, we will write the test set input to a file and upload the file to S3. This is so that we can use SageMakers Batch Transform functionality to test our model once we've fit it."

That is, we don't necessarily need to use our model's results immediately and instead we can peform inference on a large number of samples. An example of this in industry might be peforming an end of month report. This method of inference can also be useful to us as it means to can perform inference on our entire test set. \n",
